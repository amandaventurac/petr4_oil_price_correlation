# petr4_oil_price_correlation
This project has an analysis of PETR4 stock price and the oil price per Barrel from January 2000 to May 2023. The goal is to calculate the Pearson correlation and plot the curves on the same graph.

The conclusion is that the correlation is close to 0.7, it indicates a strong correlation, but not a very strong correlation as expected.
